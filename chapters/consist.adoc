== Consist Editor

The Consist Editor is a built-in part of the TSRE5 application.  It is enabled by supplying a command line option to TSRE5 when the program is started.  This option contains the value of "--conedit".  This is step that is accomplished by the supplied `ConsistEditor.bat` file.

* To use the Consist Editor you must have a version of TSRE5 that is V0.6124 or higher.
* You need to edit the `settings.txt` file and set the path to your MSTS/OR routes/trains directory, Example: `gameRoot = F:/train simulator`
* You run the `ConsistEditor.bat` file from the command line or you can use Windows Explorer to copy the `ConsistEditor.bat` file and then use "Paste Shortcut" to save it to your desktop.  You can then use the new desktop icon to start the Consist Editor.

=== How to use the Consist Editor

*The File Menu*

`File->New`::   Start a new consist
`File->Save`::  Save the current consist
`File->Exit`::  Exit the program

[NOTE]
  If you have made changes and they are unsaved when you attempt to exit, you will see the "save changes" pop-up menu.

==== Starting a new Consist or open an existing one:

* Select an existing consist from the list or click `File->New` to begin a new one
* Find a desired train item in the asset list and double click it to add it to the consist
* You can also click the desired item once to highlight it and then use one of the following buttons at the top of the list:

`Add Beg`:: Add the selected item to the beginning of the consist
`Add Cur`:: Add the selected item to the currently selected consist position
`Add End`:: Add the selected item to the end of the consist
`Add Rand`:: Add items to a list that you want in a random consist. This is a separate list. You can also save and load random consist lists  within the *"Random Consist"* pop-up dialog box.

[WARNING]
 `Add Rand` is part of a Random Consist generation tool.  It is designed to replace the current consist entirely when the `Add Random` button is pressed inside the *"Random Consist"* pop-up dialog box.  You won't lose the changes to a consist you might have been working on as you do get the option to save all pending changes upon exiting the program.

==== To Save the Current Consist

* Enter the *File Name* and *Display Name* of the current consist, if these fields are empty.
* `File->Save` -  Will save the consist file to disk

==== Consist Tools

`Consist->Reverse`:: Reverse the order of the whole consist
`Consist->Clone`:: This is the "Save As" feature, allowing you to save the current consist under a new name.
`Consist->Delete`:: Will delete the current consist from the disk
`Consist->Open in External Editor`::  _Untested_ it does nothing for me at the moment
`Consist->Save as Eng Set`:: This option is used to combine multiple items into a set.  See: <<EngineSets>>

==== Eng Tools

`Eng->Find Consists`:: Perform a filtered search, using the filter pulldown options
`Eng->Open In External Editor`:: Open the ENG or WAG file of the currently selected item in the associated editor (ORTS Compliant)
`Eng->Open Legacy ENG In External Editor`:: Open the ENG or WAG file of the currently selected item (MSTS Specific)
`Eng->Refresh Shape`:: Will refresh the displayed item from disk  




==== The Replace Menu


Now you can replace units in consists easily.

* Select a consist unit
* Find new unit in ENG list and select it, making sure it is displayed in the ENG View window. (Don't double click)
* Use one of the Replace Menu functions

`Replace->Only Selected Unit`:: Swap the consist item with a selected item from the asset list
`Replace->Replace All units in selected consist`:: Replace Unit consist-wide
`Replace->All units in all consists`:: Replace the unit in *all* consists



==== The View Menu

The view menu provides a selection of panels that can be toggled on an off to customize the way components of the Consist Editor are displayed.

For example, if all of the view options are toggled off, you will only have a blank screen.

The most useful layout will have   `Consist List`, `Eng List 1`, `Eng View` and `Con View` enabled.

As an example,  you can use the `View Menu` options to have  `ENG LIST 1` and `ENG LIST 2` enabled to use them to display Diesels in on panel and Freight cars in another ppanel based on the filter selections.


==== Graphical Consist 3D Model View

Select Items using the mouse. A selected item will have a red highlight around it.

[#EngineSets]
=== Engine Sets

*What are "eng sets"?*

Engine sets are dedicated collections of items for a better experience with multi-mesh/multi-eng locomotives, steam locomotives etc.

[IMAGE]

For example, now you can add to consist steam loco and tender in one click. 
It's possible to have many eng sets for one locomotive:

*How the "eng sets" feature works?*

Options:

1. Consist with name = eng_name -> eng set      {dot} See Note Below

2. Consist with name = eng_name#something -> eng set

Eng must be included in it's eng set consist.

[NOTE]
 {dot} Developers Comment: I think it's worth ignoring option #1 in this case because lots of default consists have names that match its eng. Looking for feedback.  For some trains it just works, for others you must create your own sets.

*How create new eng set?*

* Create new consist
* Add the items you want in new eng set
* Enter in the "File Name" that you want based on the eng name or leave it empty.
* Click `Consist -> Save as eng set`

[TIP]
 You can also use this method to create Wagon Sets by omitting an engine.  The set will be linked to the first item in the list.
