== Preface

=== General Information

* MSTS is the Microsoft Train Simulator
* {OR} or ORTS is an open source train simulator that can utilize MSTS Assets
* While {OR} is a new train simulator that can use MSTS assets, it does not come with additional utilities, such as a Route Editor, Activities Editor or Consist Editor

=== What is TSRE5? 

* TSRE5 is Game Engine that is compatible with MSTS and {OR}
* TSRE stands for Train Sim Route Explorer, the name I gave my "university homework"
* 5 is 5th version of this engine

=== Who is behind TSRE5?

The TSRE open source project is the creation of Piotr Gadecki who often goes by the nickname "GokuMK" on the train simulation related forums.


=== What can the TSRE5 program do? 

The functional components of TSRE5 are:

* Route Editor
* Track Viewer
* Activity Editor 
* Consist Editor (Which is enabled using a command line option with TSRE)


=== Why does TSRE5 exist?

{OR} needs developer utilities. MSTS needs utilities that are not stuck in the 1990's.  TSRE can solve these issues.

The utilities supplied with the Microsoft Train Simulator have always seemed a bit unpolished and in general have had to some unusual behaviors.  These behaviors include crashing at various times while editing or the random corruption of data files that can possibly lose you hours of work.

The TSRE5 application attempts to resolve some of these _new needs_ and _legacy issues_ by creating a brand new Route, Activity and Consist editor from scratch. It is fully compatible with the files created and used by the original MSTS utilities.

The TSRE5 application is for content developers who wish to create or edit routes, consists and activities for {OR} or MSTS.

=== How to Download TSRE5 


The latest version of TSRE5 is always available for download here: http://koniec.org/tsre5/data/?C=M;O=D

For example, you would download:  http://koniec.org/tsre5/data/TSRE5_v0.6955.exe as of January 2018.

[NOTE]
 If you have 32 bit Windows (usually foe use with an older computer), you would download: http://koniec.org/tsre5/data/TSRE5x32_v0.6951.exe

==== Installing TSRE5

Run the *EXE* file that was downloaded. The TSRE executable will download the additional application data from the server.

===== Manually Installing the additional TSRE application data 

If the automatic installation download doesnâ€™t work for you ( for instance, if you have Windows XP or no internet connection), download latest ZIP version from here: http://koniec.org/tsre5/data/appdata/ and then unzip into the desired directory location `tsre_appdata`):

===== What gets installed by the additional download?

Example Path to the shader directory:   `./tsre_appdata/0.69/shaders/`

If TSRE isn't working right, check to see that your installation folders look similar to this. 


==== Linking TSRE to Your Simulator Files

For TSRE to operate properly, you need to have some pre-existing simulator data folders on your computer.  This is referred to as `gameRoot` in this document. 

Possible `gameRoot` locations are:

* The MSTS root  (Where `train.exe` is located)
* An {OR} installation profile
* A Mini Route directory
* Any other Directory that has "global", "routes" and "trains" directories inside.

=== Linux

You can also download a Linux native version.  The Linux release is only available as a 64 bit version. 

The Linux version requires all of the files and directories that are located under the Root Directory, (gameRoot), to have lowercase names only.  Windows is generally a case insensitive operating system when it comes to file names, so `texture.ACE` and `Texture.Ace` refer to the same file in Windows.  This is not true with Linux. 

For example,  in an `.s` file there might be a reference to`TEXTURE.ACE`, but in the hard drive it is named `Texture.ACE`. Linux does not see these as the same file.  To deal with this issue,  the Linux TSRE program always looks for only lowercase file names. 

An example script to change all the filenames lowercase on Linux would be: 

[source,shell]
----
  rename 's!/([^/]*/?)$!\L/$1!' **/* 
----

_(It might require running it several times)_. 

There are also Windows based tools like "Bulk Rename" http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Main_Intro.php that can process the files before being moved to a Linux platform.

[#settings]
=== How to Manually Configure TSRE5 

Persistent Settings for TSRE can be managed using  the `settings.txt` in the program folder where `tsre5.exe` is located. 

[NOTE]
  Configuring the `settings.txt` file is optional but it can be very helpful. Since the program is still under development, this list of options can change.

==== How does `settings.txt` work?

You can manually change the program's default settings by editing the `settings.txt` file.  Most of the available settings options are described below: 


`#`:: Any line that starts with a `#` character is a "Comment" line and its contents are ignored.

`consoleOutput = false`::  Set this to true if you want log printed on console. It will output to a file named `log.txt`. _It seems to not be working in the current version_ 

`gameRoot = F:/train simulator`::  If you don't want to specify a root directory each time you start the application, enter the path to your desired MSTS/{OR} directory. 

[TIP]
 What is `gameRoot`? It is the directory where MSTS is installed, the {OR} installation profile, a Mini Route directory or any other Directory that has "global", "routes" and "trains" directories inside. 

`routeName = cmk`:: Place a route name here if you want to skip the Load Window and instead use this route on startup.

`startTile[x|y]`:: Optional Route Editor Start Tile position. This overrides the route settings in the `TRK` file. 

  startTileX = -5306 
  startTileY = 14961

`createNewIfNotExist = true`::  Set this to true to auto create new route if the routeName is specified and the route does not already exist. 

[TIP]
 This setting is not recommended for new users.

`writeEnabled = true`::  Set this to false if you want to disable all `Save` functions.

`writeTDB = true`:: Set this to false if you want to disable the `Save Track Database` functions.

`deleteTrWatermarks = true`:: Set this to true if you want to delete `TrWatermarks` objects in `.W` files on save.

`deleteViewDbSpheres = true`:: Set this to true if you want to delete ViewDbSpheres objects in `.W` files on save.

[TIP]
  This option is needed if you are editing an existing MSTS route and have issues with displaying the objects in MSTS/{OR}.

`geoPath = F:/hgst`::  Enter the path to directory where you have .HGT files stored if you want to use the terrain height data import in {RE}.

`systemTheme = true`:: Set to true if you want to use a system theme instead of the default dark one.

`colorConView = #FF0000`:: Consist Viewer custom background color.

`colorShapeView = #00FF00`:: Shape Viewer custom background color.

`toolsHidden = true`::  Set to true if you want to hide all tools in the {RE}.

`usenNumPad = true`::   Set to false if you have keyboard with no numpad 0-9 keys.

`tileLod = 2`::  Tile view distance. 0 = 1x1 tiles, 1 = 3x3 tiles, 2 = 5x5 tiles etc. The default MSTS value is 1.

`objectLod = 4000`:: View distance in meters. tileLod = objectLod/2000 required. The default for the MSTS {RE} is `tileLod = 1, objectLod = 2000`

`maxObjLag = 10`:: Number of new loading threads/frame. IMO, for HDD best value is 2. Lower value for older HDD and CPU, higher for SSD and better CPU. 

`allowObjLag = 1000`:: As above. Lower value may be better for HDD. Higher value increases loading speed on startup but requires SSD.

`fpsLimit = 0`::    Set FPS limit. Default 0 = no limit.

`cameraFov = 20.0`:: {RE} Camera field of view.

`cameraStickToTerrain = true`:: Camera will stick to ground level and follow terrain

`warningBox = true`:: Set to false if you don't want warning window on startup.

`leaveTrackShapeAfterDelete = false`:: Set to true if you want to manually fix broken TDB vectors in {RE}. _Only for advanced users_

`renderTrItems = true`::    Set to true if you want to see TDB items. _Only for advanced users_

`useImperial = false`:: Set to true if you want to use miles instead kilometers etc.  _Does not work currently_

`mainwindowslayout`= PWT:: Default, Other options include "TWP", "PTW", "WTP" etc.  Using just "W" will make all windows be separate.  

`UseQuadTree = false` = Disable or Enable the new rennderer.

`mouseSpeed = 0.5`::  Control mouse movement speed
