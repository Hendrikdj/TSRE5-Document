== Introduction

TSRE is, first and foremost, a route editor. It allows you to create and edit routes for {OR} and MSTS. 

It's also very fast route viewer. It's written in c++, OpenGL and QT and is based on a new Train Simulator engine that was developed a few years ago. There are no other dependencies, so all you need is a Windows system with OpenGL. MSTS does not need to be installed for this Route Editor to work. It only requires the `Global`, `Routes` and `Trains` folders.


=== Before Getting Started

To start working with Route Editor you need to:

* Have downloaded and unpacked the TSRE application
* Have at least one train simulator *gameRoot* Directory to refer to


 The *gameRoot* also referred to the *Root Dir* is one of the following items:

 * An MSTS root directory
 * An {OR} installation profile
 * A Mini Route directory
 * Any other Directory that contains "global", "routes" and "trains" folders 

=== How to Begin 

* (Optional) Set the `gameRoot` value in the application settings file to your desired Root Directory. See: <<settings>>

* Open `TSRE5.exe`, or `TSRE5x32.exe` if you are using a 32 bit version of Windows

* You might see a Warning Box. If you wish to no longer see the warning in the future, set the item `warningBox = false` in settings file. See: How to Manually Configure TSRE5
